This repository contains a MATLAB function that exhibits unexpected behavior when provided with negative inputs. The function `myFunction.m` is designed to square values greater than 5 and add 10 to values otherwise.  However, it silently returns an unexpected result for negative inputs. The corrected version, `myFunctionCorrected.m`, handles this by including error checking for invalid input values. This demonstrates a potential issue of silent failure in MATLAB when functions are not carefully designed to handle all possible input conditions.
